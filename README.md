Decision Dynamo tackles the massive productivity drain of unclear meetings by using Gemini 3 Pro's advanced multimodality not to summarize, but to *structurally deconstruct* discussions. Our web app ingests raw meeting recordings (video/audio) and supplemental slides, leveraging Gemini’s deep reasoning to identify and timestamp explicit decisions, implicit commitments, action items with owners, emerging risks, and critical open questions.

This represents a **creative leap** beyond transcription. We use Gemini’s unique ability to align spoken dialogue with on-screen content (slides, charts), creating a context-aware "Clarity Sheet" where a decision is linked to both the moment it was voiced *and* the relevant slide. The **technical execution** is real and functional: Gemini 3 Pro processes the full multimodal input to generate a structured clarity sheet.

The **impact** is tangible and immediate: converting an estimated 20-40% of lost follow-up hours back into productive work. By transforming discussions into unambiguous ownership and next steps, Decision Dynamo moves teams from vague alignment to actionable truth.
